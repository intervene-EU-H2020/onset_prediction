Description: The goal of this package is to fit a Cox-proportional hazards model to longitudinal data given different study setups. For creating a study setups see package `Istudy`. Runs the analyis based on risk groups. For `PRS` these are based on the quantiles, where the 40-60% group is the reference group. For `CCI` compares two groups based on a cutoff defined in `bin_cut`.
